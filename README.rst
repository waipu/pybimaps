pybimaps
========

Various bijective maps in pure python, internally use two dicts:
-  one 2 one: ``BijectiveMap``;
-  one 2 many: ``BijectiveListMap``, ``BijectiveSetMap``;
-  many 2 many: ``BijectiveSetSetMap``, ``BijectiveListSetMap``;

Dependencies
------------
``pybimaps`` supports >=python-3.3, and will probably work on >=python-2.7.
It does not require any other dependencies.
